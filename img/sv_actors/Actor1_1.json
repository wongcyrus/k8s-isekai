    "background_story": "Reggie hails from a small village where he was inspired by tales of brave knights. He worked tirelessly to earn a spot in the Royal Guard, although he still feels he's the luckiest person alive.",

    "description": "Reggie is a pixelated sprite depicting a young man dressed in simple but well-maintained knightly attire. He sports distinctive reddish-brown hair and clear blue eyes that hint to a bright nature. He wears a small breastplate over a white tunic, and dark brown trousers. Over his shoulders is placed a purple cape, fixed with a golden buckle. Despite his eagerness, his youthful looks and slightly clumsy movements sometimes betray his inexperience, yet he strives for excellence and recognition by his comrades.",
