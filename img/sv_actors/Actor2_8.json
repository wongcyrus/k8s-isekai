    "description": "Esmeralda, a pixel art sprite dressed in white and purple robes and an interesting headdress with the same colors. From the many positions that appear in the image, she probably is an NPC with an interesting personality, maybe that sarcastic or playful personality can hint she is a quest giver. The sprites indicate movement, blinking, idle talk, probably related to the story of the game. She wields a magical looking presence with her intense eyes, the animation of the image helps to deliver that to the players in any case.",
